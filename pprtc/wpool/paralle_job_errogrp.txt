Step-by-step execution & semantics
1. var g errgroup.Group
    Creates an errgroup.Group value g.

    Internally errgroup.Group wraps a sync.WaitGroup and collects the first non-nil error returned by any goroutine started via g.Go.

    errgroup.Group itself does not provide cancellation unless you use errgroup.WithContext (more on that later).

2. jobs := 10 and the for loop
    The loop iterates i from 1 to 10 and schedules one goroutine per iteration.

    Important closure gotcha — why jobID := i is used

    If you wrote g.Go(func() error { fmt.Println(i); ... }) directly, all goroutines could print the same i (the loop variable) because the goroutine executes later and i would have advanced.

    jobID := i creates a new local variable captured by the closure. That guarantees each goroutine sees the correct fixed job id.

3. g.Go(func() error { ... })
    g.Go does two things:

    Internally increments its WaitGroup (so g.Wait() knows to wait for this goroutine).

    Launches the provided function as a new goroutine immediately (non-blocking call).

    The function must return error. If it returns a non-nil error, errgroup records it (see next step).

    Note: g.Go returns immediately; it does not block the loop.

4. The body of each goroutine
    fmt.Printf("Processing job %d\n", jobID)
    time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
    return nil
    Here we simulate doing work (sleep). The goroutine returns nil — meaning no error for that job.

    If a goroutine returned a non-nil error, errgroup would record that error (the first non-nil one seen).

5. g.Wait()
    Blocks until all goroutines started via g.Go(...) have completed.

    Returns:

    nil if every goroutine returned nil.

    The first non-nil error encountered (it does not return multiple errors).

    Important: g.Wait() waits for all goroutines to finish, even if one returned an error — unless you used errgroup.WithContext, which pairs errgroup with a context.Context that is canceled on the first error (allowing goroutines that respect the context to stop early).

6. After g.Wait()
    If err != nil you handle the error; otherwise you can report success.

    In your code all goroutines return nil, so g.Wait() returns nil and you print ✅ All jobs done.

    Key behaviors & guarantees
    Concurrency: You create 10 goroutines; they all run concurrently (subject to scheduler/CPU).

    Ordering: No guaranteed ordering of Processing job X prints — depends on scheduler and timing.

    Error handling:

    errgroup.Group records only the first non-nil error.

    Without WithContext there is no automatic cancellation of other goroutines when one errors.

    Resource management: g.Wait() ensures you wait for completion; no goroutine leaks from these g.Go calls (assuming goroutine bodies eventually return).

    Practical production tips
    Use errgroup.WithContext if you want cancellation on error

    g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())
    g.Go(func() error {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done(): return ctx.Err()
        case <-doWork():
            // ...
        }
        return nil
    })
When any goroutine returns a non-nil error, ctx is canceled — other goroutines that observe ctx.Done() can stop early.

Limit concurrency when scheduling many tasks
Launching thousands of goroutines might be fine, but often you want a bounded worker pool. Combine errgroup + semaphore channel:

sem := make(chan struct{}, maxConcurrency)
for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
    i := i
    sem <- struct{}{}       // acquire slot
    g.Go(func() error {
        defer func(){ <-sem }() // release slot
        // work
        return nil
    })
}
g.Wait()
Collect all errors if needed
errgroup returns one error. If you need all errors, accumulate them inside goroutines (protected by a mutex) or use a multi-error aggregator.

Avoid capturing loop variables — always copy into local (as you did with jobID := i).

Make goroutines cancelable — design goroutine work to accept a context.Context so it can stop early when canceled.

Example: WithContext + bounded concurrency
A compact pattern combining cancellation and max parallelism:

g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())
sem := make(chan struct{}, 5) // at most 5 concurrent jobs

for i := 1; i <= 20; i++ {
    i := i
    sem <- struct{}{} // acquire
    g.Go(func() error {
        defer func(){ <-sem }() // release
        // check cancellation
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return ctx.Err()
        default:
        }

        // do work
        fmt.Println("processing", i)
        time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
        return nil // or an error
    })
}

if err := g.Wait(); err != nil {
    // first error or context cancellation reason
    fmt.Println("error:", err)
}
Final summary (short)
errgroup.Group makes launching and waiting for many goroutines easy.

g.Go(fn) starts a goroutine and collects any error fn returns.

g.Wait() blocks until all started goroutines finish and returns the first non-nil error (if any).

Use errgroup.WithContext to propagate cancellation on first error, and consider bounding concurrency for resource control.

If you’d like, I can:

Convert your example to use errgroup.WithContext and show early cancellation behavior, or

Show a version that uses a bounded worker pool + errgroup so you run only N goroutines concurrently while still getting errgroup error semantics. Which one do you want?
