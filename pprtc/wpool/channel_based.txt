Step-by-Step Explanation of Job Handling
1Ô∏è‚É£ jobs := make(chan int)
This is the shared job queue.

It‚Äôs unbuffered, meaning:

Every send (jobs <- j) blocks until some worker is ready to receive.

So, workers and the job producer synchronize naturally ‚Äî no job is lost or skipped.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Starting the Workers
for w := 1; w <= 5; w++ {
	wg.Add(1)
	go worker(w, jobs, &wg)
}
5 workers are launched as goroutines.

Each worker is running the same function worker(id, jobs, wg).

They immediately start waiting on this line:

for job := range jobs {
i.e., they‚Äôre blocked until a job is sent into the channel.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Sending the Jobs
for j := 1; j <= 20; j++ {
	jobs <- j
}
Now the main goroutine starts sending jobs into the channel, one by one.

For an unbuffered channel, this happens like a relay race:

jobs <- 1 ‚Üí wakes up one worker that‚Äôs waiting on range jobs.

That worker receives 1, starts processing it, and the main goroutine continues.

jobs <- 2 ‚Üí wakes up another (or possibly same, if it finished fast) worker.

And so on.

Each job is automatically distributed among available workers.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Internal Coordination ‚Äî The Scheduling Magic
You have:

5 workers waiting to receive from jobs

1 producer sending 20 jobs into jobs

Since Go‚Äôs scheduler runs goroutines cooperatively:

Each jobs <- j sends the job to one ready worker.

If all workers are busy (e.g., blocked doing I/O or computation), the main goroutine will pause at jobs <- j until any worker finishes and becomes ready again.

In other words:

Only one worker consumes a job at a time.

The scheduler balances the load automatically.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Closing the Channel
close(jobs)
After sending 20 jobs, we close the channel.

Closing means: ‚ÄúNo more jobs will come.‚Äù

Workers reading from range jobs see:

All pending jobs (if any), then

When empty and closed ‚Üí range exits automatically.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Waiting for Completion
wg.Wait()
Waits until all 5 workers call wg.Done().

Once all workers exit (because channel closed and loop ended), wg.Wait() returns.

Program ends only after all 20 jobs are fully processed.

  Process job 1    Process job 2  Process job 3  Process job 4  Process job 5
  Process job 6    Process job 7  ... etc until all 20 jobs done

You have 20 total jobs to process.

You have 5 workers, each running in a separate goroutine.

Go‚Äôs runtime automatically schedules jobs across workers:

At most 5 jobs run concurrently.

When one finishes, it picks up the next.

The process continues until all 20 jobs are done.

Would you like me to modify this to a rate-limited version (e.g., only N jobs per second) or a context-based cancellable version (stop workers when cancelled)?
