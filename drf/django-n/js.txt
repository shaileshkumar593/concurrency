JavaScript Conditional Statements
In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

1. if statement 
2. if...else statement
3. if...else if....else statement 
4. switch statement 

1. if statement 
Use this statement to execute some code only if a specified condition is true.

Syntax
if (condition)
  {
  True Statements
  }

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
var x = prompt("Enter number 10","10");
if(x==10)
{
 alert("Its Correct");
}
</script>

2. if...else statement: 
Use this statement to execute some code if the condition is true and another code(else block) if the condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition)
  {
  True Block Statements
  }
else
  {
   False Block Statements
   }

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
var b=prompt("Enter any number");
if (b>100)
{
document.write("b is greater than 100")
}
else
{
document.write("b is less than or equal to 100")
}
</script>
</head>

If...else if...else Statement:
It is used to select one of several blocks of code to be executed.

Syntax
if (condition1)
{
code to be executed if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2)
{
code to be executed if condition2 is true
}
else
{
code to be executed if neither 
condition1 nor condition2 is true
}

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
var a = prompt("Enter Any Number");
if (a > 100)
{
document.write("a is greater than 100")
}
else if(a < 100)
{
document.write("a is less than 100")
}
else
{
document.write("a is equal to 100")
}
</script>
</head>

JavaScript Switch Statement
Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed. 

Syntax
switch(n)
{
case 1:
  execute code block 1
  break;
case 2:
  execute code block 2
  break;
default:
  code to be executed if 
 is different from case 1 and 2
}

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
var book=prompt
("Enter your favorite book(HTML, JS, CSS, jQuery): ","JS")
switch(book)
{
case 'HTML':
alert("You are Selected HTML");
break;
case 'JS':
alert("You are Selected JS");
break;
case 'CSS':
alert("You are Selected CSS");
break;
default:
alert("You are Selected Wrong Book");
}
</script>
</head>

JavaScript Looping Statements:
1. for	2. while		3. do-while

1. for: 
It get executed block of statements repeatedly until the given condition satisfied.

Syntax:
for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement)
{
Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
}
 
Example:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
for (i=1;i<=5;i++)
{
document.write("The number is " + i);
document.write("<br />");
}
</script>
</body>

JavaScript While Loop 
It get executed block of statement n times.

Syntax
while (Expression/Condition)
  {
  code to be executed
  }

Example:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<script>
var i=1;
while (i<=10)
{
document.write("The number is " + i + "<br/>" );
i++;
}
</script>
</body>

do...while Loops
It get executed block of statements n+1 times.

Syntax
do
  {
  code to be executed
  }
while (Expression/Condition);

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script>
var i = 1;
do
{
document.write("The number is " + i + "<br/>" );
i++;
}
while (i<=10);
</script>
</head>
