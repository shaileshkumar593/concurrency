Create & Configure Django Apps:
A Django app is created to perform a particular functionality for your entire web application. 

Example: 
Login App, Registration App, Polling App, Feedback App..!!

App & Project in Django
1 An App is a web application which is written to perform business logic.
2 A Project is a collection of configuration files and apps for a particular website. 
3 An App can be in multiple projects.
4 A Project can contain multiple apps. 

Creating an App
To create an app, we can use the following commands.

Syntax(s):
$django-admin startapp appname
$python manage.py startapp appname
$py manage.py startapp appname
$python3 manage.py startapp appname (Linux)

Example(s):
$django-admin startapp WebApp
$python manage.py startapp WebApp
$py manage.py startapp WebApp
$python3 manage.py startapp WebApp (Linux)
 
WebApp Consist following Structure :
├──WebApp
│	├── __init__ .py
│	├──admin.py
│	├──apps.py
│	├──migrations
│	│	└── __init__ .py
│	├──models.py
│	├──tests.py
│	└──views.py

1 __init__.py 
It is an empty file that tells to the Python that this directory should be considered as a Python package.

2 admin.py
You can register your models here which Django will use them with Django's admin interface.

3 apps.py 
Here you can place application specific configurations

4 models.py 
We define our database models, which Django automatically translates into database tables

5 tests.py 
Here you can store test functions to test your code.

6 views.py 
Here we handle the request/response logic for our web app

7 migrations
This directory stores database specific information as it relates to the models.

Configuring App in Project: //settings.py
Go to Installed_apps, at the end or start, provide recently created .

Example:
#User Defined Apps
    'WebApp',

views:
A view is a place where we put our business logic of the application. 

urls: 
This is Python script that will store all URL  patterns for your project. 

How URLs, Views are working? 
The following diagram describes urls and views working principle..!!

PIC:

LIVE EXAMPLE on VIEWs & URLs:
STEP1: Create Project
$django-admin startproject djAppConfig
$cd djAppConfig

STEP2:Create Application
$django-admin startapp WebApp

STEP3:$py manage.py runserver

STEP4:Open Project with PyCharm or Any IDE(ATOM, Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Brackets..)

STEP5: Do required settings, App configuration @ Installed Apps..!!

STEP6: views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def HomePage(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to DJANGO Web World..!!")

STEP7:urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from WebApp import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('home/',views.HomePage),
]

STEP8:Run the server
$python manage.py runserver

STEP9: Open web browser, send the request to Server
127.0.0.1:8000/home
