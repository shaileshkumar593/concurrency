How to change Django Server Port:
$ py manage.py runserver 8888
Now Server running on port number: 8888
We have to send the request with this port number only
http://127.0.0.1:8888/

NOTE:
$python manage.py runserver 6666
http://127.0.0.1:6666/
If a port number already existed, It displays "This address is restricted"
